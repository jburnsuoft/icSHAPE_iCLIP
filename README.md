# icSHAPE_iCLIP

This repository contains tools to perform the overlap of experimental RNA-Binding Protein binding coordinates (iCLIP/eCLIP) with in vivo and in vitro icSHAPE RNA structural profiles.

Program conception, development, troubleshooting and publication was performed by James Burns (Greenblatt and Zhang Labs, UofT) with additional assistance from student mentee Ryan Dennison (Zhang Lab, UofT).
