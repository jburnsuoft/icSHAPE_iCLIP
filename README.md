# icSHAPE_iCLIP

This repository contains tools to perform the overlap of experimental RNA-Binding Protein binding coordinates (iCLIP/eCLIP) with in vivo and in vitro icSHAPE RNA structural profiles.

Program conception, development, troubleshooting and publication was performed by James Burns (Zhang Lab - MSc UofT) with additional assistance from student mentee Ryan Dennison (BSc UofT).
