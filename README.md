# icSHAPE_iCLIP

This repository contains tools to perform the overlap of experimental RNA-Binding Protein binding coordinates (iCLIP/eCLIP) with in vivo and in vitro icSHAPE RNA structural profiles.

Program conception, development, troubleshooting was performed by James Burns (Greenblatt and Zhang Labs, UofT) with assistance from student mentee Ryan Dennison (Zhang Lab, UofT).
