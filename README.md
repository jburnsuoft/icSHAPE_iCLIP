# icSHAPE_iCLIP

This repository contains tools to perform the overlap of experimental RNA-Binding Protein binding coordinates (iCLIP/eCLIP) with in vivo and in vitro icSHAPE RNA structural profiles.

Program and data analysis was incorporated into the following publication:
C2H2-zinc-finger transcription factors bind RNA and function in diverse post-transcriptional regulatory processes,
